    Please review the labels and make any necessary changes.

# Labels is an object where:
# - keys are labels
# - values are objects of { include: [ pattern ], exclude: [ pattern ] }
#    - pattern must be a valid regex, and is applied globally to
#      title + description of issues and/or prs (see enabled config above)
#    - 'include' patterns will associate a label if any of these patterns match
#    - 'exclude' patterns will ignore this label if any of these patterns match
labels:
  'bug':
    include:
      - '\bbug[s]?\b'
    exclude: []
  'help wanted':
    include:
      - '\bhelp( me)?\b'
    exclude:
      - '\b\[test(ing)?\]\b'
  'enhancement':
    include:
      - '\bfeat\b'
    exclude: []
